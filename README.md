Point of Sale software by Nick

the Point of Sale program will be able to complete the following functions when propted by user:

USE CASES

1. The user adds an item to the list available items at the store.
2. The user selects a set of items to purchase. She is given the total cost including tax of her order.
3. The user indicates payment has been given, the order is cleared, and the items sold are recorded.
4. The user enters a sale ID number and is shown the information regarding all sales with that number
5. The user chooses to view the entire sales record, and sees a list of the number of times each item has sold.


Classes to write for this program: 

1. Order - holds list of items in current order
2. Inventory - holds unique list of items available for purchase
3. Item - Stores data on one item available for purchase (cost,name)
4. Sale - Stores a list of items sold in a single order, and the total cost, purchaser, sale ID number.
5. SalesRecord - stores a list of every order that has been processed.

After the above classes have been written and tested fully, I will research JFrames and create a GUI to make interaction with the program easier.
